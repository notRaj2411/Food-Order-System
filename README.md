# Food Order System

This project is a food order website which also incorporates the features of a restaurant management system for the admin. HTML and CSS were used to design the front end. **PHP** was used to design the back end and connect the application to the MySQL database which stores the data for the website. **Apache** and **MYSQL** servers were set up using **Xampp**.
Customers can search and find food items based on description, category, etc and place orders. Customer and Order details are saved into the database once the customer places the order.
The web application comprises a dashboard used by a restaurant's Admin for modifying and managing orders, customers, food and categories. Admin can login and add or update food categories and modify orders. Admin can also view useful analytics such as the total number of categories, food items, orders and the total amount of revenue generated. MySQL queries are used to fetch all the relevant data.
